# Portfolio Generator

This is a portfolio generator based on the MPT - using Mean Variance Optimization

## Code

The coding approach is based on OOP concepts in python

## Models

Expected Returns: Uses the Fama-French Model to predict expected returns (Linear Regressions)

Covariance Matrix: Uses the OAS method to apply shrinkage on the matrix

## TODO

The poor performance can be attribute to the poor ability to predict expected returns.
